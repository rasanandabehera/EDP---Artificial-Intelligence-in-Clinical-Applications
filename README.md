# EDP---Artificial-Intelligence-in-Clinical-Applications
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are expanding rapidly and are revolutionizing the health care industry. AI applications cover major disease areas like cancer, neurology and cardiology, and drug research and discovery.  AI and ML offer unique strength in drawing insights from unstructured data such as images (computer vision) and free text (natural language processing). There is interest in the health care community  in the areas of radiomics, quantitative imaging, automated triage of medical imaging studies, and advanced multi-modal research utilizing rich data sources such as patient imaging, genomics, and free text clinical reports. Using these techniques brings promise to VA for more precise patient diagnosis, treatment planning, and treatment response follow-up for a broad range of conditions.
